# Movie_Recommendation_System
This project is a Movie Recommender System built with Streamlit. It suggests five similar movies based on a selected title using a precomputed similarity matrix stored in pickle files. The system integrates with the TMDb API to fetch posters, offering an interactive and visually engaging recommendation experience.
