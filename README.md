# Movie Recommender System

This project is a **Movie Recommender System** built with **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
It recommends movies similar to a userâ€™s selected choice using a **content-based recommendation approach**.  
The app also integrates with the **TMDb API** to fetch movie posters for a better user experience.

## Features
- Select any movie from the dropdown and get **top 5 similar movies**.  
- Shows **movie posters** alongside recommendations.  
- Uses **precomputed similarity matrix** for quick results.  
- Built with a simple and interactive **Streamlit** interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Streamlit** for UI  
- **Pandas** for data handling  
- **Scikit-learn & Numpy** for similarity computation  
- **Requests** for fetching posters  
- **Pickle** for storing data

## How It Works

The user selects a movie from the dropdown.

The system finds the most similar movies using a cosine similarity matrix.

The app fetches movie posters using the TMDb API.

Recommendations are displayed with posters in a clean UI.
